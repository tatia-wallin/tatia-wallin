# They call me "Tasha."
But it's spelled T-a-t-i-a.

It's probably best to just not think about it too much. It's a fairly involved explanation as to how I got my name. I think it's cool, but my name almost always causes some confusion for people who don't know me.

## What I Do

I'm currently working to get my first business off the ground and also act as the Chair of the Website Committee for Oklahoma Women in Technology. I want to help make the web a better place for all users. The web has a long way to go for that to happen, and I want to be a part of making it happen.

I really like web development. I find it fascinating and even a bit magical. My main focus has been on semantic structure in order to positively influence accessibility and SEO, but now I *really* want to learn how to build my own cool stuff and become a full-fledged web developer.

## Skillsets
* Formally educated as a graphic designer with an emphasis on motion and interactive design
* Knowledgable in HTML 5 and proper semantic structure
* Custom CSS for CMS platforms
* Experience with hosting providers, SSL/TLS certs, and SSH security keys
* Experience with Git
* Experience with basic networking concepts and techniques
* Highly-refined organization skills
* Tend to do well with public speaking

## Tatia Trivia
* I have a twin brother
* I've never broken a bone
* I've never had a cavity
* My MBTI Categorization is [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)
* One of my favorite stories to tell is when my team won a national digital video production competetion. You can [watch our team accept our awards from Phi Beta Lambda's National Leader Conference on YouTube](https://youtu.be/G9RITH5ln8Q?t=3611).
